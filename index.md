# Profile
I completed my B.Tech from College of Engineering Adoor under CUSAT; and did my M.Tech in Visual Information and Embedded Systems from IIT Kharagpur. After that I served as an engineer/researcher at Intel, AMD and Qualcomm for 8 years. My work experience mostly is in the field of Embedded System and Computer Architecture. My area of interest includes Computer Vision, Computer Architecture, Software Architecture, Embedded Systems.

## Vision
I believe engineering education should make every student fit for one of the 3 career path in the engineering discipline
  * An employee
  * An employer
  * A researcher
The simplest among the three being an employee; in which one has to put in his technical knowledge to practical use.

In India, I see an engineering skill gap. The engineering graduates are in oversupply; but most don't meet the quality expectations; hence there is an undersupply from the point of view of engineering firms. I believe the root cause of this skill gap is that our education system focuses more on grading the students than to impart practical skills; and students don't understand why they are learning a particular concept. This system has proven not able to meet the industry expectations for many years now. I believe it is a fair and worthwhile exercise to see if we can get more employable engineers by focussing equally on the application and the theory.

## Mission
  * All students being employable in the discipline and allied disciplines.
  * Finding and nurturing the enterpreneurs of tomorrow.
